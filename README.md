Note:

<h1>What is reinforcement learning? </h1>
<br>
Reinforcement learning is one of three basic machine learning paradigms, alongside supervised learning and unsupervised learning.

"Reinforcement learning differs from supervised learning in not needing labelled input/output pairs be presented, and in not needing sub-optimal actions to be explicitly corrected. Instead the focus is on finding a balance between exploration (of uncharted territory) and exploitation (of current knowledge)"

<ul>
<li>Markov Decision Processes</li>

<li>Q Learning</li>

<li>Deep Q Learning</li>

</ul>

These are typical reinforcement learning techniques. We don't have target variables (or labels) but the algorithms will figure out (and learn) the optimal strategies (when playing games such as chess or tic tac toe).
